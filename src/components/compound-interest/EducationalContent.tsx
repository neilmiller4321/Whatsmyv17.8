          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Compound interest is the process where the interest you earn on an investment is added to the principal, so that the interest itself earns interest. This creates a snowball effect that accelerates your wealth growth over time.

              <p className="text-sm">
                The longer your money is invested, the more powerful compound interest becomes. Starting early, even with smaller amounts, can lead to significantly larger returns.

                Adding regular contributions to your investment accelerates growth. Even small monthly deposits can make a substantial difference over time.

              <p className="text-sm">
                Monthly compounding is most common for savings accounts and investments. Some accounts offer daily compounding for slightly better returns, while annual compounding is typical for bonds and some fixed-rate products.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Rule of 72</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            A quick way to estimate how long it will take for your money to double is to divide 72 by your annual interest rate. For example, at 7% interest, your money will double in approximately 72 รท 7 = 10.3 years.
